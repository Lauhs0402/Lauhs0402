- 👋 Hi, I'm Laura Hoyos, a junior web developer with knowledge in testing.

I like to create and generate sustainable ideas that help the planet or homeless animals 🐈🌳☘🐕

In my spare time I like to play with my cats, read, watch my favorite series and go for a walk.

Although I consider myself an experienced junior developer, I also have a financial accounting and accounting software management technician.

I hope you can check my repositories, any feedback will be welcome.

Thank u.
